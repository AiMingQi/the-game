          The Rules:
        </h2>

        <v-row justify="left" class="text-left">
          <ol>
            <li>Players have the complete and full responsibility to audit the-game code before playing.  All client side and smart contract code is open-source and publicly available for all participants equally. Developers of the game are not responsible for the outcome of the game. <strong>Play at your own risk.</strong></li>
            <li>Only valid, unique, legally owned NFTs may play the-game.</li> 
            <li>Smart Contract and open-source Client Side logic are the Officials of the-game and CANNOT be changed or influenced during or after the-game.</li> 
            <li>Players must have valid ownership signing rights for the NFT they play.</li>
            <li>Player 1 is the game Initiator, Player 2 is the Challenger.</li>
            <li>Game Points = NFT Age (in Days since Mint) + Magic Points - Drabs </li>
            <li>1 Vote Point = 1 Game Point</li>
            <li>Each Player casts a Game Vote to determine Game Type and Outcome</li>
            <li>Game Voting:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Players distribute their Game Votes into 3 Game Type votes plus one Outcome vote.</li>
            <li>The Game Type with the most cummulative votes will be played.</li>
            <li>Outcome is based on Same / Different Logic and uses 1 Game Point to play.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Each Player votes Up or Down</li>
                <li>If Same -> Intiator Wins</li>
                <li>If Different -> Challenger Wins</li>
                <li>Up is the Default vote</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Game Types:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Love -> The Winner receives a game-baby NFT. (A valid NFT to play in future games.)</li>
              <li>Magic -> The Winner receives 2/3rds of the total vote points value as Magic Points. The Loser receives 1/3rd of the total vote points value as Drabs.</li>
              <li>Strength -> The Winner receives ownership authority of both NFTs in the-game.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the event of a tie vote, Magic is the default game.</li>
            <li>NFTs with negative points values due to Drabs CANNOT play until they have reached an age to overcome their Drabs.</li>
            <li>Players are responsible for all game fees and refunds are NOT possible.</li>
            <li>NFTs receive 1 Magic Point for every completed and valid game.</li>
            <li>NFTs must have at least +1 Game Point to play.</li>
            <li>Magic Points and Drabs only exist and are functional and valuable within the-game smart contract logic and are NOT transferable, modifiable, burnable, or exchangeable.</li>
            <li>Rules are only valid for the current version of the-game as found at the-game.fun</li>
            <li>Rules are subject to change at the discretion of the-game Developers from one game version to the next.</li>
            <li><strong>Submissions are Final and CANNOT be reversed.</strong></li>
